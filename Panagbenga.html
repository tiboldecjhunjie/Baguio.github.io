<h1>Panagbenga Festival Street Dance Parade</h1>

<p>Panagbenga Festival, locally translated to the Blooming Flowers Festival, is a yearly flower event that takes place in Baguio City, bringing together tourists.</p>
<p>The use of the word Panagbenga is reflective of the blend of cultural influences from Malaysia and other South East Asian countries. The word translates to ‘the season of bloom’. The popular festival is scheduled for February, and is held to celebrate the abundance of flowers in the city.</p>

<p>Glen Miguel, choreographer of Ilocos Norte’s Pamulinawen dance group which won last year’s street dancing competition, says he feels that this event is an “opportunity”, especially for his team since they come from a coastal region and they’re glad to be part of Baguio’s ubiquitous event. “Naiiyak ang mga bata na nandito sila sa Baguio,” he said. “Ang saya-saya nila.” (The children are teary-eyed that they are now here in Baguio. They are very happy.)</p>
